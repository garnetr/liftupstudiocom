                            This is a rough draft of rewards being planned for my combined October 2020 cross country fall colors, and wikimedia historical site photo contest, trip. Goal is to collect some reasonable funding and leave on Saturday. <br><br>Big thanks to everyone who has made a pledge and commented on the rewards!<br><br>The goal: Use GoFundMe to fund a month long photo taking tour of the United States focused first on the fall colors of the New England states, and then coming westward across the United States focusing on fall colors in the northern states, and historical monuments to photo and enter in the wikimedia historical site photo contest running this month of October 2020. If I win any prize in this contest, there are ten of them, my photo will be submitted as a finalist to an international competition.<br><br>I am also offering some consulting opportunities to help companies run a promotion related to this trip. Also opportunities to host an exhibition of these one of a kind photos. Please contact me for details.<br><br>Thank you for helping me look it over.&nbsp;<br><br>Please let me know you thoughts via email (<a href="mailto:thegarnet@gmail.com">thegarnet@gmail.com</a>) or more immediately, via text (<a href="sms:+1+415+902-3258">415-902-3258</a>) or <a href="tel:+1-415-902-3258">voice</a>.

Will be trying to minimize time in New York because of COVID quarantine rules, but no way to avoid going through New York to get to Maine, but plan to first go to Philadelphia, then shoot up the coast through Houlton, and finally St. Agatha, Maine, the northernmost lake in Maine.  3600 miles<br>* Then back down the east coast, Salisbury Maryland, Baltimore, Raleigh, Nashville, and visiting boyhood locations in Cincinnati, including the lovely Eden Park. - 5800 miles total. <br>* <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/San+Francisco,+CA/Philadelphia,+PA/Houlton,+Maine/St+Agatha,+ME/Salisbury,+MD/Baltimore,+MD/Raleigh,+NC/Charlotte,+NC/Nashville,+TN/Cincinnati,+OH/@39.8620509,-113.0479445,4z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m62!4m61!1m5!1m1!1s0x80859a6d00690021:0x4a501367f076adff!2m2!1d-122.4194155!2d37.7749295!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c6b7d8d4b54beb:0x89f514d88c3e58c1!2m2!1d-75.1652215!2d39.9525839!1m5!1m1!1s0x4ca4c1923717c66f:0xc021d6deb8bf68cf!2m2!1d-67.8402316!2d46.1261806!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cbcfe5400d63b8b:0x305dabf69291457e!2m2!1d-68.3136517!2d47.2430959!1m5!1m1!1s0x89b903ba56929e61:0xcc2a83b15b6a3b93!2m2!1d-75.5993692!2d38.3606736!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c803aed6f483b7:0x44896a84223e758!2m2!1d-76.6121893!2d39.2903848!1m5!1m1!1s0x89ac5a2f9f51e0f7:0x6790b6528a11f0ad!2m2!1d-78.6381787!2d35.7795897!1m5!1m1!1s0x88541fc4fc381a81:0x884650e6bf43d164!2m2!1d-80.8431267!2d35.2270869!1m5!1m1!1s0x8864ec3213eb903d:0x7d3fb9d0a1e9daa0!2m2!1d-86.7816016!2d36.1626638!1m5!1m1!1s0x884051b1de3821f9:0x69fb7e8be4c09317!2m2!1d-84.5120196!2d39.1031182!3e0">Google map of Segment 1</a><br><br><strong>Many of the expenses associated with this trip:</strong><br>* I would happily sleep in my car, but I am never as productive as when I get a real night's sleep. Time is of the essence with the fall colors, they do not last for long, so I need to do a motel room each night of this trip to maximize time available for photography, and use the evenings effectively to communicate about the trip to all my sponsors. Hotel rooms: 20 days at $100/day - $2000<br>* Daily gas at 16mpg. Am figuring at $2.50 a gallon, just the first segment will be about $900 in gasoline, and maybe an equivalent amount to complete the round trip.  $1800 gasoline.<br>* May need 2-3 oil changes along the way, $100 total.<br>* Food along the way, $20 per day, $400 total<br>* Monthly fees for the sponsor membership site, web server for website, photos, videos, etc., Adobe editing software, etc.  $250 per month<br>* AAA membership  $100<br>* My 2010 Grand Caravan SXT with 330K miles on it seems in good shape, but could their be car repairs along the way?<br>* <strong>Total is close to $5000</strong><br><br>I can fund this trip by stopping along the way to sharpen scissors all across the country. I am willing to do this. But it will greatly impact on the time I could be spending doing photography of the fall colors, looking for and driving to monuments, creating great aerial photography for the Wikimedia contest. <br><br>So your sponsorship is critical for me to be able to focus on photography during this trip.  <br><br>And I have a whole list of rewards for you for your help!

Let me know you want to join the funding team, and sponsor this trip at the $100 community builder sponsor level. That incliudes 20 no cost sponsor level passes to the sponsors only forum. (You could even sell those passes for a small amount of money each, between $5 or $10, and pocket those sales for yourself!)  I will award you with 10% commission on all the sponsorship that you raise for the trip.&nbsp;<br><br><em>Extra bonus:</em> When your commission totals $200, on the next payout, I will give you a free upgrade to Photowall Sponsor with all of it's benefits..<br><br><em>Extra bonus:</em> If your commission total exceeds $1200, you will get a free upgrade to whichever package is equal or lesser in value to your commisions, and I will still send you your commissions too! &nbsp;You could become a <strong>Fleet Captain,</strong> or above, just from the sponsors you bring to this campaign!<br><br>Commissions to be paid every two weeks on Paypal or Venmo, (when $50 or more commissions is owed) for sponsorships generated before the current two week period. I reserve the right to fairly modify the payout schedule, while we see what GoFundMeâs does with any sponsors who request a refund, or payments donât go through, or anything like that.<br><br><em>Special bonus:</em> Join the funding team before October 20th, and generate $500 in sponsorships before October 20th, you get a free personal upgrade to Photo Wall Sponsor, which three beautiful framable prints of your choice from this trip.<br><br><em><strong>And one last special: Lifetime 10% commission on the sponsors that you bring.  If sponsors you bring later make additional contributions, for example buying extra photos, or upgrade to higher levels like copilot or fleet captain, you get 10% commission on those upgrades too.</strong></em><br><br><br><br>Notes:<br>*Location - I am an FAA licensed sUAS Remote Pilot, and I respect the limits on where I can legally fly. More about that in the sponsor forum, in a private area for discussion for copilots, fleet captains and fleet executives. No federal parks like Yosemite are allowed, no flights within miles of the capital in Washington D.C., no flying over people at events, etc. If you desire a very specific location for your sponsorship, please contact me to discuss your requested location ahead of arrival, so I can make sure it is legal for me to fly there, and make sure the trip is planned around your needs. If you can be flexible in your higher level donation (Fleet Captain and above), I will keep in close contact with you during the trip to offer you locations as they come up to provide one that meets your needs..&nbsp;<br></p>
