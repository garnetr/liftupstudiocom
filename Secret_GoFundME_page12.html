                            This is a rough draft of rewards being planned for my combined October 2020 cross country fall colors, and wikimedia historical site photo contest, trip. Goal is to collect some reasonable funding and leave on Saturday. <br><br>The goal: Fund a month long photo taking tour of the United States focused first on the fall colors of the New England states, and then coming westward across the United States focusing on fall colors in the northern states, and historical monuments to photo and enter in the wikimedia historical site photo contest running this month of October 2020. If I win any prize in this contest, there are ten of them, my photo will be submitted as a finalist to an international competition.<br><br>I am also offering some consulting opportunities to help your company run a promotion related to this trip. Also opportunities to host an exhibition of these one of a kind photos. Please contact me for details.<br><br>Thank you for helping me look it over.&nbsp;<br><br>Please let me know you thoughts via email (<a href="mailto:thegarnet@gmail.com">thegarnet@gmail.com</a>) or more immediately, via text (<a href="sms:+1+415+902-3258">415-902-3258</a>) or <a href="tel:+1-415-902-3258">voice</a>.

Only one chairman position avialable, and chairman position is for a term of 3 months, giving you priority determination of where trips are conducted during your term. Flights do not expire, and unused flights may be used after your term expires.<br><br>Notes:<br>*Location - I am an FAA licensed sUAS Remote Pilot, and I respect the limits on where I can legally fly. More about that in the sponsor forum, in a private area for discussion for copilots, fleet captains and fleet executives. No federal parks like Yosemite are allowed, no flights within miles of the capital in Washington D.C., no flying over people at events, etc. If you desire a very specific location for your sponsorship, please contact me to discuss your requested location ahead of arrival, so I can make sure it is legal for me to fly there, and make sure the trip is planned around your needs.  If you can be flexible in your higher level donation (Fleet Captain and above), I will keep in close contact with you during the trip to offer you locations as they come up to provide one that meets your needs..&nbsp;<br></p>
